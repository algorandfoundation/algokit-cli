## What is AlgoKit?

AlgoKit compromises of a number of components that make it the one-stop shop tool for developers building on the [Algorand network](https://www.algorand.com/).

![AlgoKit components](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/algorandfoundation/algokit-cli/main/docs/imgs/algokit-map.png)

AlgoKit can help you [**learn**](#learn), [**develop**](#develop) and [**operate**](#operate) Algorand solutions. It consists of [a number of repositories](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Aalgorandfoundation+algokit-&type=repositories), including this one.

### Learn

There are many learning resources on the [Algorand Developer Portal](https://developer.algorand.org/) and the [AlgoKit landing page](https://developer.algorand.org/algokit) has a range of links to more learning materials. In particular, check out the [quick start tutorial](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/get-started/algokit/) and the [AlgoKit detailed docs page](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/get-details/algokit/).

If you need help you can access both the [Algorand Discord](https://discord.gg/84AActu3at) (pro-tip: check out the algokit channel!) and the [Algorand Forum](https://forum.algorand.org/).

We have also developed an [AlgoKit video series](https://www.youtube.com/@algodevs/playlists).

### Develop

AlgoKit helps you develop Algorand solutions:

- **Interaction**: AlgoKit exposes a number of interaction methods, namely:
  - [**AlgoKit CLI**](https://github.com/algorandfoundation/algokit-cli/blob/main/docs/algokit.md): A Command Line Interface (CLI) so you can quickly access AlgoKit capabilities
  - [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/): All AlgoKit project templates include VS Code configurations so you have a smooth out-of-the-box development experience using VS Code
  - [Dappflow](https://dappflow.org/): AlgoKit has integrations with Dappflow; a web-based user interface that let's you visualise an Algorand network and deploy and call smart contracts via a graphical user interface
- **Getting Started**: AlgoKit helps you get started quickly when building new solutions:
  - [**AlgoKit Templates**](https://github.com/algorandfoundation/algokit-cli/blob/main/docs/features/init.md): Template libraries to get you started faster and quickly set up a productive dev experience
- **Development**: AlgoKit provides SDKs, tools and libraries that help you quickly and effectively build high quality Algorand solutions:
  - **AlgoKit Utils** ([Python](https://github.com/algorandfoundation/algokit-utils-py#readme) | [TypeScript](https://github.com/algorandfoundation/algokit-utils-ts#readme)): A set of utility libraries so you can develop, test, build and deploy Algorand solutions quickly and easily
    - [algosdk](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/sdks/) ([Python](https://github.com/algorand/py-algorand-sdk#readme) | [TypeScript](https://github.com/algorand/js-algorand-sdk#readme)) - The core Algorand SDK providing Algorand protocol API calls, which AlgoKit Utils wraps, but still exposes for advanced scenarios
  - [**Beaker**](https://beaker.algo.xyz/): A productive Python framework for building Smart Contracts on Algorand.
    - [PyTEAL](https://pyteal.readthedocs.io/en/stable/): The Python language bindings for Algorand Smart Contracts, which Beaker wraps
    - [TEAL](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/get-details/dapps/smart-contracts/): Transaction Execution Approval Language (TEAL) is the assembly-like language interpreted by the Algorand Virtual Machine (AVM) running within an Algorand node, which Beaker exports
  - [**AlgoKit LocalNet**](https://github.com/algorandfoundation/algokit-cli/blob/main/docs/features/localnet.md): A local isolated Algorand network so you can simulate real transactions and workloads on your computer

### Operate

AlgoKit can help you deploy and operate Algorand solutions.

AlgoKit comes with out-of-the-box [Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) templates](https://github.com/algorandfoundation/algokit-beaker-default-template) that help you rapidly set up best-practice software delivery processes that ensure you build quality in and have a solution that can evolve

## What can AlgoKit help me do?

The set of capabilities supported by AlgoKit will evolve over time, but currently includes:

- Quickly run, explore and interact with an isolated local Algorand network (LocalNet)
- Building, testing, deploying and calling [Algorand PyTEAL](https://github.com/algorand/pyteal) / [Beaker](https://beaker.algo.xyz/) smart contracts

For a user guide and guidance on how to use AlgoKit, please refer to the [docs](https://github.com/algorandfoundation/algokit-cli/blob/main/docs/algokit.md).

Future capabilities are likely to include:

- Quickly deploy [standardised](https://github.com/algorandfoundation/ARCs/#arcs-algorand-requests-for-comments), audited smart contracts
- Building and deploying Algorand dApps

## Is this for me?

The target audience for this tool is software developers building applications on the Algorand network. A working knowledge of using a command line interfaces and experience using the supported programming languages is assumed.

## How can I contribute?

This is an open source project managed by the Algorand Foundation. See the [contributing page](https://github.com/algorandfoundation/algokit-cli/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) to learn about making improvements to the CLI tool itself, including developer setup instructions.

# Install

## Prerequisites

The key required dependency is Python 3.10+, but some of the installation options below will install that for you.

AlgoKit also has some runtime dependencies that also need to be available for particular commands.

> **Note**
> You can still install and use AlgoKit without these dependencies and AlgoKit will tell you if you are missing one for a given command.

- Git - Git is used when creating and updating projects from templates
- Docker - Docker Compose (and by association, Docker) is used to run the AlgoKit LocalNet environment, we require Docker Compose 2.5.0+

## Cross-platform installation

AlgoKit can be installed using OS specific package managers, or using the python tool [pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/) see below for specific installation instructions.

- [Windows](#install-algokit-on-windows)
- [Mac](#install-algokit-on-mac)
- [Linux](#install-algokit-on-linux)
- [pipx](#install-algokit-with-pipx-on-any-os)

## Install AlgoKit on Windows

> **Note**
> This method will install the most recent python3 version [via winget](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/winget/). If you already have python 3.10+ installed, you may [prefer to use pipx directly instead](#install-algokit-with-pipx-on-any-os) so you can control the python version used.

1. Ensure prerequisites are installed

   - [Git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git#install-git-on-windows) (or `winget install git.git`)
   - [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/) (or `winget install docker.dockerdesktop`)
     > **Note**
     > See [our LocalNet documentation](https://github.com/algorandfoundation/algokit-cli/blob/main/docs/features/localnet.md#prerequisites) for more tips on installing Docker on Windows

2. Install using WinGet

   1. Install python: `winget install python.python.3.11`
   2. Restart the terminal to ensure Python and pip are available on the path

      > **Note**
      > Windows has a feature called **App Execution Aliases** that provides redirects for the Python command that guide users to the
      > Windows Store. Unfortunately these aliases can prevent normal execution of Python if Python is installed via other means, to disable them
      > search for **Manage app execution aliases** from the start menu, and then turn off entries listed as
      > **App Installer python.exe** or **App Installer python3.exe**.

   3. Install pipx:
      ```
      pip install --user pipx
      python -m pipx ensurepath
      ```
   4. Restart the terminal to ensure pipx is available on the path
   5. Install AlgoKit via pipx: `pipx install algokit`
   6. Restart the terminal to ensure AlgoKit is available on the path

3. [Verify installation](#verify-installation)

### Maintenance

Some useful commands for updating or removing AlgoKit in the future.

- To update AlgoKit: `pipx upgrade algokit`
- To remove AlgoKit: `pipx uninstall algokit`

## Install AlgoKit on Mac

> **Note**
> This method will install Python 3.10 as a dependency via Homebrew. If you already have python installed, you may prefer to use `pipx install algokit` as explained [here](#install-algokit-with-pipx-on-any-os).

1. Ensure prerequisites are installed

   - [Homebrew](https://docs.brew.sh/Installation)
   - [Git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git#install-git-on-mac) (should already be available if `brew` is installed)
   - [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/), (or `brew install --cask docker`)
     > **Note**
     > Docker requires MacOS 11+

2. Install using Homebrew `brew install algorandfoundation/tap/algokit`
3. Restart the terminal to ensure AlgoKit is available on the path
4. [Verify installation](#verify-installation)

### Maintenance

Some useful commands for updating or removing AlgoKit in the future.

- To update AlgoKit: `brew upgrade algokit`
- To remove AlgoKit: `brew uninstall algokit`

## Install AlgoKit on Linux

1. Ensure prerequisites are installed

   - [Python 3.10+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

     > **Note**
     > There is probably a better way to install Python than to download it directly, e.g. your local Linux package manager

   - [pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/#on-linux-install-via-pip-requires-pip-190-or-later)
   - [Git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git#install-git-on-linux)
   - [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/)

2. Continue with step 2 in the following section to install via [pipx](#install-algokit-with-pipx-on-any-os)

## Install AlgoKit with pipx on any OS

1. Ensure desired prerequisites are installed

   - [Python 3.10+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
   - [pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/installation/)
   - [Git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git)
   - [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

2. Install using pipx `pipx install algokit`
3. Restart the terminal to ensure AlgoKit is available on the path
4. [Verify installation](#verify-installation)

### Maintenance

Some useful commands for updating or removing AlgoKit in the future.

- To update AlgoKit: `pipx upgrade algokit`
- To remove AlgoKit: `pipx uninstall algokit`

## Verify installation

Verify AlgoKit is installed correctly by running `algokit --version` and you should see output similar to:

```
algokit, version 1.0.1
```

> **Note**
> If you get receive one of the following errors:
>
> - `command not found: algokit` (bash/zsh)
> - `The term 'algokit' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program.` (PowerShell)
>
> Then ensure that `algokit` is available on the PATH by running `pipx ensurepath` and restarting the terminal.

It is also recommended that you run `algokit doctor` to verify there are no issues in your local environment and to diagnose any problems if you do have difficulties running AlgoKit. The output of this command will look similar to:

```
