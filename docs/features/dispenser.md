# AlgoKit TestNet Dispenser

The AlgoKit Dispenser feature allows you to interact with the AlgoKit TestNet Dispenser. This feature is essential for funding your wallet with TestNet ALGOs, refunding ALGOs back to the dispenser wallet, and getting information about current fund limits on your account.

## Usage

```zsh
$ algokit dispenser [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...
```

This command provides a set of subcommands to interact with the AlgoKit TestNet Dispenser.
Subcommands

- `login`: Login to your Dispenser API account.
- `logout`: Logout of your Dispenser API account.
- `fund`: Fund your wallet address with TestNet ALGOs.
- `refund`: Refund ALGOs back to the dispenser wallet address.
- `limit`: Get information about current fund limits on your account.

### CI Access Token

All dispenser commands can work in non-interactive mode by using a CI access token that can be generated by passing `--ci` flag to `login` command. Once a token is obtained, setting the value to the following environment variable `ALGOKIT_DISPENSER_ACCESS_TOKEN` will enable non-interactive mode for all dispenser commands. If both an interactive and non-interactive access token is available, the non-interactive mode will take precedence.
