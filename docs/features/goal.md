# AlgoKit goal

AlgoKit goal command provides the user with a mechanism to run [goal cli](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/clis/goal/goal/) commands against the current [AlgoKit LocalNet](./localnet.md).

You can explore all possible goal commands by running `algokit goal` e.g.:

```
$ ~ algokit goal
 GOAL is the CLI for interacting Algorand software instance. The binary 'goal' is installed alongside the algod binary and is considered an integral part of the complete installation. The binaries should be used in tandem - you should not try to use a version of goal with a different version of algod.

 Usage:
 goal [flags]
 goal [command]

 Available Commands:
 account     Control and manage Algorand accounts
 app         Manage applications
 asset       Manage assets
 clerk       Provides the tools to control transactions
 completion  Shell completion helper
 help        Help about any command
 kmd         Interact with kmd, the key management daemon
 ledger      Access ledger-related details
 license     Display license information
 logging     Control and manage Algorand logging
 network     Create and manage private, multi-node, locally-hosted networks
 node        Manage a specified algorand node
 protocols
 report
 version     The current version of the Algorand daemon (algod)
 wallet      Manage wallets: encrypted collections of Algorand account keys

 Flags:
 -d, --datadir stringArray   Data directory for the node
 -h, --help                  help for goal
 -k, --kmddir string         Data directory for kmd
 -v, --version               Display and write current build version and exit

 Use "goal [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

For instance, running `algokit goal report` would result in output like:

```
$ ~ algokit goal report

If the AlgoKit Sandbox `algod` docker container is not present or not running, the command will fail with a clear error, e.g.:

```
$ ~ algokit goal
 Error: No such container: algokit_algod
 Error: Error executing goal; ensure the Sandbox is started by executing `algokit sandbox status`
```

```
$ ~ algokit goal
 Error response from daemon: Container 5a73961536e2c98e371465739053d174066c40d00647c8742f2bb39eb793ed7e is not running
 Error: Error executing goal; ensure the Sandbox is started by executing `algokit sandbox status`
```

## Working with Files in the Container
When interacting with the container, especially if you're using tools like goal, you might need to reference files or directories. Here's how to efficiently deal with files and directories:

### Automatic File Mounting
When you specify a file or directory path in your `goal` command, the system will automatically mount that path from your local filesystem into the container. This way, you don't need to copy files manually each time.

For instance, if you want to compile a `teal` file:

```
algokit goal clerk compile /Path/to/inputfile/approval.teal -o /Path/to/outputfile/approval.compiled
```
Here, `/Path/to/inputfile/approval.teal` and `/Path/to/outputfile/approval.compiled` are paths on your local file system, and they will be automatically accessible to the `goal` command inside the container.

### Manual Copying of Files

In case you want to manually copy files into the container, you can do so using `docker cp`:

```
docker cp foo.txt algokit_algod:/root
```
This command copies the `foo.txt` from your local system into the root directory of the `algokit_algod` container.

Note: Manual copying is optional and generally only necessary if you have specific reasons for doing so since the system will auto-mount paths specified in commands.

## Running multiple commands

If you want to run multiple commands or interact with the filesystem you can execute `algokit goal --console`. This will open a [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) shell session on the `algod` Docker container and from there you can execute goal directly, e.g.:

```
$ algokit goal --console
Opening Bash console on the algod node; execute `exit` to return to original console
