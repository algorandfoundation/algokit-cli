# Vulnerability Disclosures

The Algorand Foundation takes the security of the platform and of its users very seriously. We recognize the important role of external security researchers and developers in helping keep our community safe. We ask that you use common sense when looking for security bugs. Vulnerabilities must be disclosed to us privately with reasonable time to respond, and avoid compromise of other users and accounts, or loss of funds that are not your own.

If you believe that you have found a security vulnerability for any software within https://github.com/algorandfoundation, you may disclose it here:

security@algorand.foundation.

For vulnerabilities within go-algorand, please refer to https://github.com/algorand/go-algorand/security.
